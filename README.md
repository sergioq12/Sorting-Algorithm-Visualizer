# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a project that I created to visualize Sorting Algorithms. 

### Description
This project encompasses some Sorting Algorithms such as:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

In the project, the idea was to have an html version that will help visualize the algorithms in order to not only understand how they work, but also appreciate the different efficiencies that they can have. I have to say that it is surpsising if you compare the speed of the different algorithms. 

Within the project there are two sliders that allow the user to interact with the number of elements to sort and the speed to sort them. The speed slider can be changed amid the sorting is happening. This allows to see how the algorithm performs either slowly to appreciate how the process works or fastly to show how the algorithms work from a macro perspective. 

Thank you!

This project was made by Sergio Quijano

I, Sergio Quijano, did a presentation about this project that can be found in the files shared. It tries to explain how I started from this idea to actually develop it. I attempt to show simple examples about how the algorithms work.
